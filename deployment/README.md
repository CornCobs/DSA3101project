# Web App with Streamlit

The easiest way is to use `Anaconda` package manager.

1. Start up `Anaconda Navigator`
2. Go to `Environments` Tab and create a new virtual environment
3. Activate the virtual environment
4. Open `VS Code` in `Home` Tab
5. Open the project directory. The project structure should follow that of the repository (in particular `data` and `models` folders).
6. From the terminal (Ctrl+Shift+\`) in VS Code, run `streamlit run src/app.py`.
You may have to download requirements with the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
